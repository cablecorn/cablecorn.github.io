  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Caleb, and I am an undergraduate student currently 
     studying computer science. I'm currently on an accelerated bachelor's
     to master's degree program, with plenty of interests in the field 
     including</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>Graphics Programming</li>
    <li>Game Engine Architecture</li>
    <li>Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
    <li>and now Web Dev!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'm certainly new to the field, and I haven't been able to experience
     every pathway within the field quite yet. That being said, my interests
     change every day, and I am so excited to be able to learn more!</p>
